# A Probabilistic Interpretation of Precision, Recall and F-Score, with Implication for Evaluation

This repo contains example code reproducing some examples and graphs from the ECIR-2005 paper "A Probabilistic Interpretation of Precision, Recall and F-Score, with Implication for Evaluation" by Cyril Goutte and Eric Gaussier. This paper is receiving significant citation even 15 years after it was published (in fact it got its highest #citations so far in 2020), and received the ECIR test of time award in 2016, which suggest that some peopl did find it useful.

This is meant to help people who would like to re-implement the tests described in Sections 2 and 3 of the paper.
